Instead, they're living in the communal Hacker Hostel owned by former programmer Erlich, who gets to claim ten percent of anything they invent there. When it becomes clear that Richard has developed a powerful compression algorithm for his website, Pied Piper, he finds himself courted by Gavin Belson, his egomaniacal corporate boss, who offers a $10 million buyout by his firm, Hooli. But Richard holds back when well-known investor Peter Gregory  makes a counteroffer.\thttp://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/10897/silicon-valley-1x01-minimum-viable-product\n2014-04-13\t2014-04-13T22:00:00-04:00\t22:00\t10898\tThe Cap Table\t2\t30\t1\tAfter a celebratory party at the Hacker Hostel, Richard and Erlich learn that Peter Gregory won't pay up until they deliver a viable business plan that includes a slimmed-downed staff. A desperate Richard hires former Belson underling Jared, and they set about trying to trim the fat. While Gilfoyle and Dinesh prove essential, Big Head's place in the company is less certain.\thttp://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/10898/silicon-valley-1x02-the-cap-table\n2014-04-20\t2014-04-20T22:00:00-04:00\t22:00\t10899\tArticles of Incorporation\t3\t30\t1\tWhile Gavin Belson begins to hype Nucleus, a competing compression platform, Richard learns that the name Pied Piper is already registered to a sprinkler company, forcing him to negotiate.
